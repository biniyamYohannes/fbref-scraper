#This web scraper will scrape player statistics from fbref.com and store them in a MySQL database.

#What to collect:
- only data for the current season (2019-2020) or equivalent most recent season
- only the top 5 leagues because other leagues have vastly different formatting of player data

#What data do I need?
-Player information - name, age (DOB?), height, weight, nationality, positions played, club, league
-Player data - appearances, stats (passing, offensive, defensive)

#STAGE 1 - PARSING:
- Write a working scraper for one player's personal info
- Write a working scraper for one player's data for one season
	-first section of every table is repeated
	-maybe a function taking two arguments; one for the header and one for the value?

#STAGE 2 - CRAWLING
- URL validation and exception handling (using generic functions: URLError, HTTPError, AttributeError, p.29)
- Crawler will crawl the website and will pass appropriate pages to the parsers
-add exception handling for missing data (for example, Ferand Mendy is missing weight data)

#STAGE 3 - MySQL
-add basic functionality for connecting to a database, creating a table and storing data in the table
-fix formatting for country of birth and playing position
-specify data types for different columns in the table
-fix the excessive exception handling messages
---### DONE ###---
-fix the scraping of player data
-start incorporating the player data into the database

-CHANGE THE PASSWORD BEFORE COMMITING TO GITHUB!!!

#STAGE 4 - ANALYSIS?


08/16/2020
- fixed formatting for player position and country of birth
- added sleep function to limit the load on the server (the program pauses for 2 seconds before sending a new request)
- changed the data type of the MySQL table columns for height, weight, and age to int
- prettied up the output so it prints only the dictionary, the attempted SQL statements/exceptions, and the 2 second sleep
